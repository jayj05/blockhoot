# Kahoot-Clone

## Introduction 

This project is a clone of Kahoot! with my own twist to the gameplay. Instead of players competing against each other in trivia, they will be navigating a set of predetermined mazes using block code. Each time a maze is completed their score is increased, and the first to complete the final maze is the winner. 

Front-End:
